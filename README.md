## School and Testing Analysis for PyCity Schools

### Acting as a Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity School District, I conducted an analysis of school data alongside standardized test data for the district. 

### This analysis is designed to assist the school board in making stategic decisions regarding future school budgetary needs. 

### Through the aggregation of this data, the following trends have been observed:
- Higher spending does not necessarily lead to better performance by the students
    - There is no consistency in higher testing scores for the district in the highest spending range per student. Schools grouped in lower spending ranges show better success on passing rates and tests scores. This leads one to draw a conclusion that spending alone is not a strong predictor of success rates for students. 
- The data shows that Charter schools might be providing a stronger education when compared to district schools. This is evidenced by the higher math, reading, and overall averages. 
- In regard to future spending:
    - There would be an overall benefit to focus on math improvement programs. Since the data clearly showed that consistenly all types of schools have higher outcomes for reading, than math; schools would benefit from allocating additonal funds on programs that can lead to improvements for math gaps within all schools. 
    - Larger schools show a need for more efficient resource 
    allocation. The data shows that they generally underperform on test scores and passing rates. Providing these schools with a targeted path for budget increases would assist with improving overall support services for the larger student populations. 

### To conclude, even though higher spending practices do not necessarily improve outcomes, strategic and clearly outlined allocated budget plans could result in higher achievements no matter the school or it's demographic informmation.
